How Arcium Computes on Data It Never Sees
An interactive deep dive into Multi-Party Computation (MPC), one of the core technical concepts behind the Arcium Network.
What This Is
This is an educational explainer built for the Arcium RTG challenge. It takes one specific technical concept from Arcium's architecture — Multi-Party Computation and secret sharing — and makes it understandable for everyone, with no cryptography background required.
What It Covers
The real-world data breach problem MPC solves
How traditional computing exposes data during processing
What Multi-Party Computation actually is, explained from first principles
An interactive secret sharing demo where you can watch your data shatter into keyshares
Shamir's Secret Sharing — the mathematical engine underneath Arcium
How Arcium's Cerberus protocol detects and stops cheating nodes
Why this matters for Africa, Europe and the future of AI
